# Life Echo

Life Echo turns your camera into short-term memory.

With a single tap ‚Äî or even just a blink ‚Äî you can instantly record a 3-second video clip. Everything is stored locally, offline, with thumbnails for quick recall.

Instead of taking scattered notes or blurry photos, Life Echo captures moments as they happen ‚Äî parking spots, posters, faces, ideas ‚Äî in their real context.

Built entirely with Web APIs inside CodeGryphon, it works on mobile and desktop, supports front/rear camera switching, hands-free blink triggering, offline PWA install, and export/import for backups.

It‚Äôs fast, private, and feels like having a personal ‚Äúmemory buffer‚Äù in your pocket.

## Project Structure

- index.html ‚Äî minimal UI (camera preview, record button, status, gallery, template)
- styles.css ‚Äî dark theme, responsive layout for camera and gallery
- manifest.json ‚Äî PWA metadata (name, theme, icons)
- service-worker.js ‚Äî offline cache (cache-first), versioned
- src/
  - app.js ‚Äî app bootstrap: wires features together
  - recorder.js ‚Äî getUserMedia + MediaRecorder wrapper
  - storage.js ‚Äî IndexedDB storage for clips and thumbnails
  - thumbnail.js ‚Äî generate PNG thumbnails from video blobs
  - features/
    - recording/ ‚Äî camera init, record, switch camera
    - gallery/ ‚Äî render list, play, delete
    - blink/ ‚Äî lightweight blink detector using canvas luminance samples
    - thumb/ ‚Äî safeMakeThumbnail with timeout and fallback
    - status/ ‚Äî setStatus and setBusy helpers
    - backup/ ‚Äî export/import handlers
  - utils/
    - download.js ‚Äî client-side blob downloader
  - data/ ‚Äî reserved for future data modules

## Key Features

- One-tap recording of 3-second video clips (MediaRecorder)
- Local offline storage (IndexedDB) with thumbnails for quick recall
- Gallery with playback and deletion
- Blink-triggered hands-free capture (adaptive luminance baseline)
- Camera switching (front/rear) with remembered setting
- Offline-first PWA: installable, works without network
- Export/Import backups (single JSON file bundle)

## Technical Highlights

- 100% Web APIs: MediaDevices, MediaRecorder, Canvas, IndexedDB, Service Worker
- No external libraries, no network required to operate
- Cache-first service worker with versioned CACHE_NAME (bump on asset changes)
- Relative paths for GitHub Pages-friendly deployments
- iOS-friendly: playsinline preview, user-gesture camera paths supported
- Robust thumbnail generation with timeout and black-fallback
- Safe ObjectURL lifecycle management for images and players

## How It Works

- Recording: initRecorder attaches a Stream to <video#preview>. recordFor() starts MediaRecorder, collects Blob chunks, resolves after duration.
- Storage: IndexedDB object store "clips" keeps { id, filename, timestamp, blob, thumbnail }. Listing returns metadata; blobs are fetched on demand.
- Thumbnails: We seek a frame and draw to canvas at 320px width, return PNG Blob (or fallback on timeout).
- Blink detection: Samples ROI brightness every ~70ms; detects short darkness drop and rise versus adaptive baseline; triggers recording once per capture window.
- PWA: service-worker.js precaches core assets; fetch handler serves cached responses and updates cache opportunistically.

## Setup & Run

- Serve over HTTPS or localhost for camera access
- Deploy on GitHub Pages or any static hosting
- First run may require granting camera permission

Local dev (any static server):
- Use a simple static server, e.g. `python -m http.server` and open https via a proxy, or use a local HTTPS server setup.

## Build & CI

- CI workflow validates JS syntax and ensures required files exist, then deploys to GitHub Pages
- No bundling/build step required; ES modules are used directly

## Usage

- Open the app
- Switch camera if needed (üîÑ)
- Tap Record to capture 3s; or let the blink detector trigger hands-free
- Clips appear in the list with thumbnails; tap to play
- Export all clips to a JSON backup; restore via Import

## Privacy

- All data stays on your device. No analytics, no external APIs.

## Troubleshooting

- If updates don‚Äôt appear, unregister the Service Worker and hard-reload; CACHE_NAME is bumped to force updates
- On iOS, permissions may prompt more often; you can start camera via a user gesture to reduce prompts
